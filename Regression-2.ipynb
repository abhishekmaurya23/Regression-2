    "R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. It is used as a measure of how well the regression model fits the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",
    "- 1 indicates that the model explains all the variability of the response data around its mean.\n",

    "- \\( SS_{tot} \\) is the total sum of squares, which represents the total variation in the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared can also be interpreted as the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by the model. For instance, an R-squared value of 0.75 indicates that the model explains 75% of the variability in the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that R-squared alone does not indicate whether the regression model is adequate or not, and it should be used in conjunction with other evaluation metrics and diagnostic tools. R-squared does not account for overfitting and can be misleading when used in the presence of multicollinearity or in models with high complexity. Therefore, it is crucial to assess R-squared in combination with other metrics such as adjusted R-squared, mean squared error, and residual plots to evaluate the overall performance of the regression model."
